# Link Filter

An Alfred workflow that quickly finds links in pasted text.

Pastebomb some text, and this workflow will present all link-like sequences as options for your perusal. 

It's okay with multiple subdomains, prefixes, and all possible valid link characters. In the current version, it only supports http/s links.
